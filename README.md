# Nopain a Java build system

Recently I tried Maven and got cancer from it, so I figured I could attempt to create my own mini build system for Java inspired by Cargo.

During this endavour I discovered that the java compiler and the overall process also sucks ass and I hate all of it and especially myself for making me do this.
